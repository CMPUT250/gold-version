MAZE MOD:

Follow the rain looking light visual. Basically there's music playing in this area. When you go to the living room, you turn off the music from the jukebox. 

Then all the doors lock and your goal is to take the hatchet and bash all the doors open. 


>>MISSING SOME CREATURES. 
Spawn some monsters when all the doors are locked and maybe some traps.
