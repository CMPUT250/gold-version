THis is for the final level:


You start at the long hallway called "Hallway to Boiler room"

Make a trigger somewhere in that hall that says
"I wonder if Fred's ok… what is going on…?"

Then you open the door to the left in that hallway to a room. 

Make a trigger that has a phone call noise. 
I added a small script so that you can talk to placables (in this case, the phone on the table).

Touch the phone placable and start the conversation with Fred.

Then you need to get to the Boiler room area to the end to win.
