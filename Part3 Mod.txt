NEED TO ADD THE CONVOS AND DO THE TRIGGERS IN SCRIPTEASE

Part 3 script for PART3 MOD:

In ShoreFire Area: 
ENTRANCE TRIGGER: Boss starts conversation with Player
Boss: Jack!
Jack: Boss, what happened? Who killed her? What's going on?
Boss: I don't know Jack… but it seems like someone wants this case to be silent. 
Jack: …But who? Maybe Mary knew something...
Boss:  She probably did. Listen Jack. We are going to keep this case quiet right now. The last thing we need are those news reporters rats banging on our door. 
Jack: The case seems worse than I thought…
Boss: I know… anyways,  here's the key to the apartment basement. I know you want to reopen the case, but if you decide to, you are on your own. 
Jack: You're giving me the key to the apartment?
Boss: Yeah, Mary was last seen going to the apartment. Anyways, no one told you about this alright? 
Jack: Yes sir.
Boss: And be careful. That place has been abandoned but I've heard there are still gas leaks. Be careful.
Jack:  I won't let you down, chief. 

Fred: Jack! Did you hear about that woman who died? What was her name? Lana?
Jack: It was Mary. Apparently she was last seen by that Apartment before she died. 
Fred: What? Who did it?
Jack:… I don't know.
Fred: Someone really must want this case taken out…
Jack: I know… but who..?

Put a trigger in the apartment somewhere: 
I really need to find out what happened to Mary… what the heck is going on in this apartment?
